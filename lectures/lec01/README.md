Ways to view these slides:

1. **Recommended:** Clone this repo and open [Introduction.ipynb](Introduction.ipynb) in ipython, which will allow you to run and modify the example code:

  git clone https://github.com/iit-cs429/main.git
  cd main/lectures/lec01
  ipython notebook Introduction.ipynb
  ```
2. The [online notebook version](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/iit-cs429/main/blob/master/lectures/lec01/Introduction.ipynb)
2. The [online slides version](https://rawgithub.com/iit-cs429/main/master/lectures/lec01/Introduction.slides.html), which was created with `ipython nbconvert --to slides Introduction.ipynb`. These will look somewhat different from the view in class, which used [ipython slideshow support](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fperez/nb-slideshow-template/blob/master/install-support.ipynb).
3. The code from class is in [Introduction.py](Introduction.py). The original markdown content of the slides is included as comments. This was created with `ipython nbconvert --to python Introduction.ipynb`
