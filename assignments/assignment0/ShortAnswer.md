Edit this file in your private repository to provide answers to the following questions (from MRS).

1. Extend the postings merge algorithm to arbitrary Boolean query formulas. What is
its time complexity? For instance, consider:

`(Brutus OR Caesar) AND NOT (Antony OR Cleopatra)`

Can we always merge in linear time? Linear in what? Can we do better than this?
